# Basic-Banking-System


I have done this project under the intership offered by GRIP of The Sparks Foundation (TSF).
In this project I have made a Basic Banking System which provide a user interface to the customer to transfer money between the multiple users or customers and can also see their past transaction.
In this project I have used React as frontend and Node JS as backend with MongoDB as database to store customer and transaction information.
